- By default it search images by model name.
- To search by tags you have to prefix t: , for example t:anime
- To search by prompt you have to prefix p: , for example p:1girl

# ComfyUI params

I recommend this node to save params so SD-Manager can parse the metadata, https://github.com/alexopus/ComfyUI-Image-Saver
